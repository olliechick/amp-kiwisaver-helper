<h2>Premise</h2> <!-- This premise is duplicated in the readme -->
<p>
  The New Zealand Government will pay 50 cents for every dollar that you contribute to your KiwiSaver, up to $521.43 per
  year. So to take full advantage of this, you want to contribute at least $1,042.86 each year. This is calculated over
  the period 1 July–31 June.
  See <a href="https://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/new/benefits/mtc/" target="_blank">kiwisaver.govt.nz/new/benefits/mtc</a>
  for more details.
</p>
<p>
  If your KiwiSaver is with AMP, they can generate a report which includes your contributions for an arbitrary date
  range as a CSV, but they don't give you a total for the contributions that count towards the $1,042.86.
  The only way to get that information is to email them at
  <a href="mailto:kiwisaver@amp.co.nz" target="_blank">kiwisaver@amp.co.nz</a>
  and ask for it, but that gets tiresome (although it is a good
  way to double-check).
</p>
<p>
  I created this website that creates a CSV of only the contributions that count towards the $1,042.86.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
  Download the CSV from AMP (log in → Accounts → AMP KiwiSaver Scheme → Transactions) from 1 July to the current date.
</p>
<p>
  On this website, select the "Upload CSV file" button and select the CSV file.
  The transactions will then be displayed. To download them, select the "Download CSV file" button.
  The total amount contributed will be displayed, as well as how much you have left to contribute (if any).
</p>

<h2>What contributions count?</h2>
<p>
  Currently, only the following contributions count. (Are there more?
