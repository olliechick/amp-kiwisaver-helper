# AMP KiwiSaver helper

A tool to calculate how much you will need to pay to make the most of government contributions based on reports generated by AMP.

This is published to [olliechick.co.nz/kiwisaver](https://olliechick.co.nz/kiwisaver).

## Premise
  The New Zealand Government will pay 50 cents for every dollar that you contribute to your KiwiSaver, up to $521.43 per
  year. So to take full advantage of this, you want to contribute at least $1,042.86 each year. This is calculated over
  the period 1 Julyâ€“31 June.
  See <a href="https://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/new/benefits/mtc/" target="_blank">kiwisaver.govt.nz/new/benefits/mtc</a>
  for more details.
  
  If your KiwiSaver is with AMP, they can generate a report which includes your contributions for an arbitrary date
  range as a CSV, but they don't give you a total for the contributions that count towards the $1,042.86.
  The only way to get that information is to email them at
  <a href="mailto:kiwisaver@amp.co.nz" target="_blank">kiwisaver@amp.co.nz</a>
  and ask for it, but that gets tiresome (although it is a good
  way to double-check).

  I created this website that creates a CSV of only the contributions that count towards the $1,042.86.
